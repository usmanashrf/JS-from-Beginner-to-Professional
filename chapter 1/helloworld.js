// use of console
console.log("Hello world")


//use of prompt
//this prompt will only work on browser
//prompt("Hi! How are you?");

//Random Number
//this is the command to create a random number:
// Math.random();
console.log(Math.random())

//This number will be a decimal between 0 and 1. If we want a number between 0 and 
//100, we can multiply it by 100, like this:

console.log(Math.random() * 100);

//If we don't want to have a decimal result, we can use the Math.floor function on it, 
//which is rounding it down to the nearest integer:

console.log(Math.floor(Math.random() * 100));
